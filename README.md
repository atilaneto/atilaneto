## Hello there, I'm √Åtila Neto üëã

- Studying Computer Science in Brazil, at INTELI (Institute of Technology and Leadership)

- About me: I'm passionate about music, motorsport, astonishing ventures, cinema, football, and basketball. At the age of six, I began learning to play the acoustic guitar and the drums, all while being a goalkeeper. When I turned 10, I started playing classical guitar in my school‚Äôs freshman orchestra. Two years later, I advanced to the main orchestra, where I played for another two years. Eventually, I decided to step away from the orchestra to focus solely on studying classical guitar, as my attention shifted to a new passion: basketball. Playing as a point guard was mentally and physically challenging most of the time. Nonetheless, that journey allowed me to meet my non-blood family and create countless unforgettable memories.
